subject  : research questions 

----
the question which are kept are : 
- Can we address the task of link prediction in a semantic knowledge base to an entailment model ?
- What are the performances of an entailment model in a zero shot and few shot design on a link prediction task ?
- Can an entailment task outperform an embedding graph method for link prediction ?

for 10/10/2023
BENCHMARK ON LINK PREDICTION 
- find the benchmark used and most suited for this task 
- find the metric they use
- find the state of the art performance on which we will have to perform

- make an experiment plan
