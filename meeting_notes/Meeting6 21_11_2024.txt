Meeting Notes 21/11/2024

TODOs ; 
Code : TRAINING 
- DONE  necessity to had a config file for the hyperparameter for each model training
-	see to improve its speed on expert server (new parameters + parallelization) 
+   see how much examples are above 1024 token

Code : IMPROVEMENT 
-	Retrain all the model with a 100% training on WN with bigger batch size and optimized parameters 
-	Implement majority voting as intermediate step
+   Build the data2meta.py : code which agregate the three models to generate the probability for each eaxample for training and testing
-	Build a meta model : Use the newly trained models to generate a training set for the meta model 

Code : EVALUATION 
- DONE	add MRR in the evaluation metric 
- DONE	Improve evaluation speed with parallelization
-	See how it is done in the literature
-	Evaluate the models one by one and with the meta model (MRR + hit@)
