Meeting Notes 14/11/2024

TODOs ; 
Code : TRAINING 
+ DONE  necessity to had a config file for the hyperparameter for each model training
-	see to improve its speed on expert server (new parameters + parallelization) 

Code : IMPROVEMENT 
-	Retrain all the model with a 100% training on WN with bigger batch size and optimized parameters 
-	Implement majority voting as intermediate step 
-	Build a meta model : Use the newly trained models to generate a training set for the meta model 

Code : EVALUATION 
-	add MRR in the evaluation metric 
-	Improve evaluation speed with parallelization
-	See how it is done in the literature
-	Evaluate the models one by one and with the meta model (MRR + hit@)
