[+] DONE  Test all scripts (deberta-small + GPU : expert)

We have : 
- Training pipeline : DONE - TESTED
- Meta Training pipeline : DONE - TESTED
- Evaluation pipeline : IP 


-	Retrain all the model with a 100% training on WN with bigger batch size and optimized parameters 
    ( 3 training for WN Naive ) <- Done
    ( 3 training for FB Naive )
    ( 3 training for WN MNLI ) <- Done
    ( 3 training for FB MNLI )

[+] check the sota and check the ressources - size of the data how explainble - know more about the sota to compare them 

Code : EVALUATION 
-	See how it is done in the literature
-	Evaluate the models one by one and with the meta model (MRR + hit@)
