Meeting Notes 14/11/2024

TODOs ; 
Hardware : 
- DONE	Find and configure a school GPU --> DONE (venv created - GPU only work between 8am to 6pm in week days)
- DONE	Configure Expert.ai GPU (install Docker) --> DONE (code tested with christian)
Code : TRAINING 
- DONE	Find a small model and a small train/test/valid set for prototyping new run glue (named hf_trainer.py)
- DONE	Rewrite runglue.py program, it is way too complicated to modify and understand what going on like that 
- DONE	test hf_trainer on school GPU to check bugs (without docker)
- DONE	test hf_trainer on expert server to check bugs (with docker) --> DONE (the ne programm have been tested on Expert GPU it works - still need improvement)
+   necessity to had a config file for the hyperparameter for each model training
-	see to improve its speed on expert server (new parameters + parallelization) 
Code : IMPROVEMENT 
-	Retrain all the model with a 100% training on WN with bigger batch size and optimized parameters 
-	Implement majority voting as intermediate step 
-	Build a meta model : Use the newly trained models to generate a training set for the meta model 

Code : EVALUATION 
-	add MRR in the evaluation metric 
-	Improve evaluation speed with parallelization
-	See how it is done in the literature
-	Evaluate the models one by one and with the meta model (MRR + hit@)
